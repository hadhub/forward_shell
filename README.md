## üìã Description

This Python script provides an interactive shell that allows remote command execution on a vulnerable server by exploiting JWT tokens with a known secret. It includes advanced features such as directory management and file transfer.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive shell**: Intuitive command-line interface
- **System navigation**: Functional `cd` and `pwd` commands
- **File transfer**: Binary file upload via base64 or hexadecimal
- **Filter bypass**: Uses `${IFS}` to replace spaces
- **Persistent context**: Maintains working directory between commands

## üîß Prerequisites

```bash
pip install requests pyjwt
```

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jwt-rce-shell.git
cd jwt-rce-shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Configuration

Modify the constants in the script before use:

```python
TARGET = 'http://TARGET/'      # Target URL
SECRET = "JWT_SECRET"          # Known JWT secret
```

## üíª Usage

### Launch

```bash
python shell.py
```

### Special commands

| `cd <path>` | Change directory | `cd /tmp` |
| `pwd` | Display current directory | `pwd` |
| `upload <local> [remote]` | Upload a file (base64) | `upload exploit.sh` |
| `uploadhex <local> [remote]` | Upload a file (hex) | `uploadhex payload.bin` |
| `exit` / `quit` | Exit the shell | `exit` |
